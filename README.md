<p>
 Defining Role Permissions: In the role settings page, you will see a list of available permissions. Enable or disable the checkboxes next to each permission to grant or restrict access for the role you're creating. The available permissions may vary based on the osTicket version and any plugins you have installed.

Permissions typically include actions like managing tickets, managing knowledgebase articles, managing departments, and accessing specific settings. Consider your organizational needs and the level of access each role should have.

Department Signature: You can add a signature that will be appended to outgoing emails from this department.
Department Manager: Assign a manager to the department who will have additional privileges and responsibilities within the department.
Ticket Assignment: Determine how tickets are assigned within the department, such as "Round Robin" or "Direct Assignment."

 Defining Department Permissions: By default, all staff members have access to all departments. However, if you want to restrict access to specific departments, you can edit individual staff members' profiles and limit their department access.

To do this, navigate to the "Staff" tab in the admin panel and select "Manage" and then "Staff Members." Edit a staff member's profile and choose the departments they should have access to by checking the appropriate checkboxes under the "Department Access" section.
